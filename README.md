# symbolicDifferentiator

Python code that takes a one-variable polynomial and return its symbolic derivative.

Use as symbolic variable 'x', and to exponentiate it use 'x**'.
A multiplication symbol '*' is expected between a numeric prefactor and the symbolic variable (i.e., 2*x**2).

If using the terminal, execute the following command from the git-repo directory: python3 symbolicDifferentiator.py
